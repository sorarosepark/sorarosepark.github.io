### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab that was interactive, taking in two numbers using cin and using else/if functions to compare the two values and even give the user feedback on whether the number was too high/low. This was our first lab using if/else statements which definitely In the later labs, we added on to this and created compound statements and it was neat to see how what we were learning could apply to different scenarios and make our programs work in more of a complex way. 


* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was another one of my favorite labs, where given 100 numbers, we were to write a program that filtered out even numbers and print out the number of even numbers as well as the number of integers that were multiples of 3 and 5. We used a for loop to iterate through the numbers and if statements to filter the numbers. On top of that, we used the modulus operator to utilize the remainder number as either even or multiples of 3 and 5 when the number % was equal to zero! I particularly liked this lab because I didnâ€™t really find much use in the modulus operator until then. It proved to me how math and its application of it really do play a role in computer science. Such cool usage of the modulus operator! 


* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it showed me how programs we code could even create images (that is, a repeated number of characters in a specific order, but nonetheless an image). We were given a specific pattern to replicate and to do so we utilized nested counter-controlled for loops, 3 in total, one outer loop and two inner. It was interesting to see how utilizing different loop patterns could create contrasting arrangements.
